## Problem Statement

The next greater element of some element x in an array is the first greater element that is to the right of x in the same array.

You are given two distinct 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, where nums1 is a subset of nums2.

For each 0 <= i < nums1.length, find the index j such that nums1[i] == nums2[j] and determine the next greater element of nums2[j] in nums2. If there is no next greater element, then the answer for this query is -1.

Return an array ans of length nums1.length such that ans[i] is the next greater element as described above.

```Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2]
Output: [-1,3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
- 1 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. The next greater element is 3.
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. The next greater element is 3.
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
```



## Final Solution

```python
class Solution(object):
    def nextGreaterElement(self, nums1, nums2):
        """
        :type nums1: List[int]
        :type nums2: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        next_greater = {}  # Store the next greater element
        stack = []  # Monotonic stack
        result = []  # Final results for nums1

        # Iterate through nums2
        for i in range(len(nums2)):
            if i == len(nums2) - 1:  # Last element gets -1
                next_greater[nums2[i]] = -1
            while stack and nums2[i] > stack[-1]:  # Pop and map greater element
                element = stack.pop()
                next_greater[element] = nums2[i]
            
            # Push current element onto the stack
            stack.append(nums2[i])
        
        # For remaining elements in stack, assign -1 as no greater element exists
        while stack:
            element = stack.pop()
            next_greater[element] = -1
        
        # Map nums1 elements using next_greater
        for i in range(len(nums1)):
            result.append(next_greater.get(nums1[i], -1))
        
        return result
